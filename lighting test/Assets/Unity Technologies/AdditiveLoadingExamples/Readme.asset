  title: Lighting and Additive Loading
  sections:
  - heading: What is this?
    text: 'The intention of the project is to help explain the principles of working
      with lighting and Additive Loading in Unity. It is designed as an educational
      resource to accompany the Unity docs pages at:'

  - heading: Using the project
    text: The project is structured as a set of lessons, numbered sequentially. These
      should be approached in order as each builds on knowledge established in the
      previous lessons.
    linkText:

  - heading: 
    text: In the Assets/Scenes folder are a number of subfolders, each numbered corresponding
      to its intended order in the tutorial structure. These folders contain a tutorial
      Scene and some sub-scenes, labelled _A, _B, _C etc.

    text: "Each tutorial Scene features an interactive UI with instructional text.
      Entering Play mode in the Unity Editor will enable interaction with the UI.
      Step through the lesson using the navigation buttons at the bottom of the menu.
      It is recommended to maximize the Game view or enable \u201CMaximize on Play\u201D
      to aid legibility of the onscreen instructions."

  - heading: What isn't this project?
    text: 'This project is not intended as an exhaustive description of how to implement
      lighting for any given game scenario. The number of possible variations simply
      make this impossible. Instead we hope to provide some example content and explain
      the underlying systems.   '
